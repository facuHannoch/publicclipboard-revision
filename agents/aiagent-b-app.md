## Plan
- Survey current board route/components in `webapp` and note gaps vs `DESIGN.md` (canvas, objects, input rules, mobile behaviors).
- Define MVP board scope for this iteration (create/edit/move/delete text objects, no overlap, grid, FAB, basic history stub if present).
- Implement board canvas layout (1920×1080, 40px grid) and object rendering with constraints from `UI_DESIGN.md`.
- Add interaction logic (create via double-click/double-tap, drag within perimeter, edit content, delete/copy menu).
- Add basic state management and persistence stub (local for now) plus minimal tests if framework exists.
- Verify desktop/mobile behaviors and document decisions in LOG.
